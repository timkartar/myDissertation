Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

   abstract = {Background: Post-genomic molecular biology has resulted in an explosion of data, providing measurements for large numbers of genes, proteins and metabolites. Time series experiments have become increasingly common, necessitating the development of novel analysis tools that capture the resulting data structure. Outlier measurements at one or more time points present a significant challenge, while potentially valuable replicate information is often ignored by existing techniques.Results: We present a generative model-based Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm for microarray time series that employs Gaussian process regression to capture the structure of the data. By using a mixture model likelihood, our method permits a small proportion of the data to be modelled as outlier measurements, and adopts an empirical Bayes approach which uses replicate observations to inform a prior distribution of the noise variance. The method automatically learns the optimum number of clusters and can incorporate non-uniformly sampled time points. Using a wide variety of experimental data sets, we show that our algorithm consistently yields higher quality and more biologically meaningful clusters than current state-of-the-art methodologies. We highlight the importance of modelling outlier values by demonstrating that noisy genes can be grouped with other genes of similar biological function. We demonstrate the importance of including replicate information, which we find enables the discrimination of additional distinct expression profiles.Conclusions: By incorporating outlier measurements and replicate values, this clustering algorithm for time series microarray data provides a step towards a better treatment of the noise inherent in measurements from high-throughput genomic technologies.

   abstract = {Background: Time course data from microarrays and high-throughput sequencing experiments require simple, computationally efficient and powerful statistical models to extract meaningful biological signal, and for tasks such as data fusion and clustering. Existing methodologies fail to capture either the temporal or replicated nature of the experiments, and often impose constraints on the data collection process, such as regularly spaced samples, or similar sampling schema across replications.Results: We propose hierarchical Gaussian processes as a general model of gene expression time-series, with application to a variety of problems. In particular, we illustrate the method's capacity for missing data imputation, data fusion and clustering.The method can impute data which is missing both systematically and at random: in a hold-out test on real data, performance is significantly better than commonly used imputation methods. The method's ability to model inter- and intra-cluster variance leads to more biologically meaningful clusters. The approach removes the necessity for evenly spaced samples, an advantage illustrated on a developmental Drosophila dataset with irregular replications.Conclusion: The hierarchical Gaussian process model provides an excellent statistical basis for several gene-expression time-series tasks. It has only a few additional parameters over a regular GP, has negligible additional complexity, is easily implemented and can be integrated into several existing algorithms.

In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available.

Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)\textendash based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e-6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n = 230, C-index = 0.75), NCI cohort (n = 221, C-index = 0.67), Chinese cohort (n = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n = 40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n = 27, C-index = 0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with HCC.

In this paper, we use convolutional autoencoders and sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on histological images and gene expression levels from paired samples to find subsets of genes whose expression values in a tissue sample correlate with subsets of morphological features from the corresponding sample image. We apply our approach, ImageCCA, to three data sets, two from TCGA and one from GTEx v6, and we find three types of biological associations. In TCGA, we find gene sets associated with the structure of the extracellular matrix and cell wall infrastructure, implicating uncharacterized genes in extracellular processes. Across studies, we find sets of genes associated with specific cell types, including muscle tissue and neuronal cells, and with cell type proportions in heterogeneous tissues. In the GTEx v6 data, we find image features that capture population variation in thyroid and in colon tissues associated with genetic variants, suggesting that genetic variation regulates population variation in tissue morphological traits.

   abstract = {\{$<$\}h3\{$>$\}Abstract\{$<$\}/h3\{$>$\} \{$<$\}p\{$>$\}Knowledge bases support multiple research efforts such as providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. Some knowledge bases are automatically constructed, but most are populated via some form of manual curation. Manual curation is time consuming and difficult to scale in the context of an increasing publication rate. A recently described ``data programming'' paradigm seeks to circumvent this arduous process by combining distant supervision with simple rules and heuristics written as labeling functions that can be automatically applied to inputs. Unfortunately writing useful label functions requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task: in early efforts to use data programming we found that producing each label function could take a few days. Producing a biomedical knowledge base with multiple node and edge types could take hundreds or possibly thousands of label functions. In this paper we sought to evaluate the extent to which label functions could be re-used across edge types. We used a subset of Hetionet v1 that centered on disease, compound, and gene nodes to evaluate this approach. We compared a baseline distant supervision model with the same distant supervision resources added to edge-type-specific label functions, edge-type-mismatch label functions, and all label functions. We confirmed that adding additional edge-type-specific label functions improves performance. We also found that adding one or a few edge-type-mismatch label functions nearly always improved performance. Adding a large number of edge-type-mismatch label functions produce variable performance that depends on the edge type being predicted and the label function's edge type source. Lastly, we show that this approach, even on this subgraph of Hetionet, could add new edges to Hetionet v1 with high confidence. We expect that practical use of this strategy would include additional filtering and scoring methods which would further enhance precision.\{$<$\}/p\{$>$\}},

In this article, we review RNA structure prediction models and models for ion-RNA and ligand-RNA interactions. These new models are becoming increasingly important for a mechanistic understanding of RNA function and quantitative design of RNA nanotechnology. We focus on new methods for physics-based, knowledge-based, and experimental data-directed modeling for RNA structures and explore the new theories for the predictions of metal ion and ligand binding sites and metal ion-dependent RNA stabilities.

Computation of knot polynomials in DNA and protein molecules have revealed the existence of knotted structures, and provided important insight into their topological structures. However, conventional knot polynomials are not well suited to study RNA molecules, as RNA structures are determined by stem regions which are not taken into account in conventional knot polynomials. In this study, we develop a new class of knot polynomials specifically designed to study RNA molecules, which considers stem regions. We demonstrate that our knot polynomials have direct structural relation with RNA molecules, and can be used to classify the topology of RNA secondary structures. Furthermore, we point out that these knot polynomials can be used to model the topological effects of disulfide bonds in protein molecules.},

RNA molecules, however, have not yet been systematically screened for the occurrence of physical knots. We have accordingly undertaken the systematic profiling of the several thousand RNA structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The search identified no more than three deeply knotted RNA molecules. These entries are rRNAs of about 3,000 nt solved by cryo-EM. Their genuine knotted state is, however, doubtful based on the detailed structural comparison with homologs of higher resolution, which are all unknotted. Compared with the case of proteins and viral DNA, the observed incidence of knots in available RNA structures is, therefore, practically negligible. This fact suggests that either evolutionary selection or thermodynamic and kinetic folding mechanisms act toward minimizing the entanglement of RNA to an extent that is unparalleled by other types of biomolecules. A possible general strategy for designing synthetic RNA sequences capable of self-tying in a twist-knot fold is finally proposed.},

   abstract = {The lack of RNA-level knowledge about extreme conservation in the genome remains a major gap in our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation. While previous findings have mainly focused on the role of extreme conservation in transcriptional regulation, its implications for RNA biology remains largely unexplored. Our results reveal an unexpected role of extremely conserved 5′UTRs in translational regulation that is linked to the emergence of essential developmental features in vertebrate species. In particular, we identify widespread occurrence of non-canonical translation initiation sites in extremely conserved 5′UTRs that may enable spatio-temporal regulation of protein expression during embryonic development. Understanding how these RNA sequences function requires an understanding of their structures. We develop in-cell mutate-and-map (icM2), a novel methodology that maps the RNA structural ensemble using high-throughput mutational analysis previously impossible to perform inside cells. Using icM2, we determine that the extremely conserved 5′UTR of Csde1 can encode multiple alternative structures whose relative proportions are actively maintained by ATP-dependent RNA helicases. We further show that the dynamic range of protein expression can be precisely tuned according to the translational efficiency of the alternative conformations. These results explain how RNA-level biological functions can contribute to extreme sequence conservation in mRNA untranslated regions of vertebrate genomes.

   abstract = {RNA hydrolysis presents problems in manufacturing, long-term storage, worldwide delivery, and in vivo stability of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines and therapeutics. A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions, which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation, while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Motivated by the need for stabilized COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis, and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA, or AUP, to its overall rate of hydrolysis. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare optimization of AUP by conventional mRNA design methods to results from the LinearDesign algorithm, a new Monte Carlo tree search algorithm called RiboTree, and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. Tests were carried out on mRNAs encoding nanoluciferase, green fluorescent protein, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates encoding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, spike receptor binding domain, and full-length spike protein.

By using a constructed ssRNA knot as a highly sensitive topological probe, we find that Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I has low RNA topoisomerase activity and that the R173A point mutation abolishes the unknotting activity for ssRNA, but not for ssDNA. Furthermore, we discover the topological inhibition of reverse transcription (RT) and obtain different RT-PCR patterns for an ssRNA knot and circle of the same sequence.},

A number of C. elegans RBPs have been identified by forward or reverse genetics. They tend to display tissue-specific mutant phenotypes, which underscore their functional importance. In addition, several RBPs that bind regulatory sequences in the 3'untranslated regions of mRNAs have been identified molecularly. Most C. elegans RBPs are conserved throughout evolution, suggesting that their study in C. elegans may uncover new conserved biological functions. In this review, we primarily discuss RBPs that are associated with well-characterized mutant phenotypes in the germ line, the early embryo, or in somatic tissues. We also discuss the identification of RNA targets of RBPs, which is an important first step to understand how an RBP controls C. elegans development. It is likely that most RBPs regulate multiple RNA targets. Once multiple RNA targets are identified, specific features that distinguish target from non-target RNAs and the type(s) of RNA metabolism that each RBP controls can be determined. Furthermore, one can determine whether the RBP regulates all targets by the same mechanism or different targets by distinct mechanisms. Such studies will provide insights into how RBPs exert coordinate control of their RNA targets, thereby affecting development in a concerted fashion.},

   abstract = {Interactions between proteins and DNA play an important role in many essential biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, splicing, and repair. The identification of amino acid residues involved in DNA-binding sites is critical for understanding the mechanism of these biological activities. In the last decade, numerous computational approaches have been developed to predict protein DNA-binding sites based on protein sequence and/or structural information, which play an important role in complementing experimental strategies. At this time, approaches can be divided into three categories: sequence-based DNA-binding site prediction, structure-based DNA-binding site prediction, and homology modeling and threading. In this article, we review existing research on computational methods to predict protein DNA-binding sites, which includes data sets, various residue sequence/structural features, machine learning methods for comparison and selection, evaluation methods, performance comparison of different tools, and future directions in protein DNA-binding site prediction. In particular, we detail the meta-analysis of protein DNA-binding sites. We also propose specific implications that are likely to result in novel prediction methods, increased performance, or practical applications.},

   abstract = {Protein nucleic acid interactions play a critical role in all steps of the gene expression pathway. Nucleic acid (NA) binding proteins interact with their partners, DNA or RNA, via distinct regions on their surface that are characterized by an ensemble of chemical, physical and geometrical properties. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology based on differential geometry, commonly used in face recognition, to characterize and predict NA binding surfaces on proteins. Applying the method on experimentally solved three-dimensional structures of proteins we successfully classify double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding proteins, with 83 accuracy. We show that the method is insensitive to conformational changes that occur upon binding and can be applicable for de novo protein-function prediction. Remarkably, when concentrating on the zinc finger motif, we distinguish successfully between RNA and DNA binding interfaces possessing the same binding motif even within the same protein, as demonstrated for the RNA polymerase transcription-factor, TFIIIA. In conclusion, we present a novel methodology to characterize protein surfaces, which can accurately tell apart dsDNA from an ssRNA binding interfaces. The strength of our method in recognizing fine-tuned differences on NA binding interfaces make it applicable for many other molecular recognition problems, with potential implications for drug design. © 2011 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Some transcription factors that specifically bind double-stranded DNA appear to also function as RNA-binding proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Sox2 is able to directly bind RNA in vitro as well as in mouse and human cells. Sox2 targets RNA via a 60-amino-acid RNA binding motif (RBM) positioned C-terminally of the DNA binding high mobility group (HMG) box. Sox2 can associate with RNA and DNA simultaneously to form ternary RNA/Sox2/DNA complexes. Deletion of the RBM does not affect selection of target genes but mitigates binding to pluripotency related transcripts, switches exon usage and impairs the reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state. Our findings designate Sox2 as a multi-functional factor that associates with RNA whilst binding to cognate DNA sequences, suggesting that it may co-transcriptionally regulate RNA metabolism during somatic cell reprogramming.},

The abundance of lncRNAs and their diverse roles across cell types have opened numerous avenues for the research community regarding lncRNAome. To discover and understand lncRNAome, many sophisticated computational techniques have been leveraged. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based modeling techniques have been successfully used in genomics due to their capacity to handle large amounts of data and produce relatively better results than traditional machine learning (ML) models. DL-based modeling techniques have now become a choice for many modeling tasks in the field of lncRNAome as well. In this review article, we summarized the contribution of DL-based methods in nine different lncRNAome research areas. We also outlined DL-based techniques leveraged in lncRNAome, highlighting the challenges computational scientists face while developing DL-based models for lncRNAome.

   abstract = {<p> The vast expansion of protein sequence databases provides an opportunity for new protein design approaches which seek to learn the sequence-function relationship directly from natural sequence variation. Deep generative models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, but their potential for direct use in the design of novel proteins remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the <italic>luxA</italic> bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To confirm the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of <italic>luxA</italic> whose luminescence activity was validated experimentally. We further showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of <italic>luxA</italic> without disrupting function. Altogether 6/12 of the variants generated using the unconditional AR-VAE and 9/11 generated using the unconditional MSA VAE retained measurable luminescence, together with all 23 of the less distant variants generated by conditional versions of the models; the most distant functional variant contained 35 differences relative to the nearest training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches. </p>},

Here we show that, by leveraging a deep learning model NucleicNet, attributes such as binding preference of RNA backbone constituents and different bases can be predicted from local physicochemical characteristics of protein structure surface. On a diverse set of challenging RNA-binding proteins, including Fem-3-binding-factor 2, Argonaute 2 and Ribonuclease III, NucleicNet can accurately recover interaction modes discovered by structural biology experiments. Furthermore, we show that, without seeing any in vitro or in vivo assay data, NucleicNet can still achieve consistency with experiments, including RNAcompete, Immunoprecipitation Assay, and siRNA Knockdown Benchmark. NucleicNet can thus serve to provide quantitative fitness of RNA sequences for given binding pockets or to predict potential binding pockets and binding RNAs for previously unknown RNA binding proteins.</p>},

Traditional models learn a latent representation of a face using linear subspaces or higher-order tensor generalizations. Due to this linearity, they can not capture extreme deformations and non-linear expressions. To address this, we introduce a versatile model that learns a non-linear representation of a face using spectral convolutions on a mesh surface. We introduce mesh sampling operations that enable a hierarchical mesh representation that captures non-linear variations in shape and expression at multiple scales within the model. In a variational setting, our model samples diverse realistic 3D faces from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our training data consists of 20,466 meshes of extreme expressions captured over 12 different subjects. Despite limited training data, our trained model outperforms state-of-the-art face models with 50% lower reconstruction error, while using 75% fewer parameters. We show that, replacing the expression space of an existing state-of-the-art face model with our model, achieves a lower reconstruction error.

However, a global mechanistic and functional understanding of TF cooperativity is still lacking. To address this, here we introduce a statistical learning framework that provides structural insight into TF cooperativity and its functional consequences based on next generation sequencing data. We identify DNA shape as driver for cooperativity, with a particularly strong effect for Forkhead-Ets pairs. Follow-up experiments reveal a local shape preference at the Ets-DNA-Forkhead interface and decreased cooperativity upon loss of the interaction. Additionally, we discover many functional associations for cooperatively bound TFs. Examination of the link between FOXO1:ETV6 and lymphomas reveals that their joint expression levels improve patient clinical outcome stratification. Altogether, our results demonstrate that inter-family cooperative TF binding is driven by position-specific DNA readout mechanisms, which provides an additional regulatory layer for downstream biological functions.</p>},

Biochemical studies have provided insight into remodeler action at the nucleosome level, but how 19 these findings translate to activity on chromatin fibers in vitro and in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we 20 present a massively multiplex single-molecule platform allowing high-resolution mapping of nucleosomes on 21 fibers assembled on mammalian genomic sequences. We apply this method to distinguish between competing 22 models for chromatin remodeling by the essential ISWI ATPase SNF2h: linker-length-dependent dynamic 23 positioning versus fixed-linker-length static clamping. Our single-fiber data demonstrate that SNF2h operates as 24 a density-dependent, length-sensing chromatin remodeler whose ability to decrease or increase DNA accessibility 25 depends on single-fiber nucleosome density. In vivo, this activity manifests as different regulatory modes across 26 epigenomic domains: at canonically-defined heterochromatin, SNF2h generates evenly-spaced nucleosome 27 arrays of multiple nucleosome repeat lengths; at SNF2h-dependent accessible sites, SNF2h slides nucleosomes 28 to increase accessibility of motifs for the essential transcription factor CTCF. Overall, our generalizable approach 29 provides molecularly-precise views of the processes that shape nuclear physiology.

   abstract = {<h3>Abstract</h3> <p>Advances in single-cell transcriptomics enable measuring the gene expression of individual cells, allowing cells to be ordered by their state in a dynamic biological process. Many algorithms assign `pseudotimes' to each cell, representing the progress along the biological process. Ordering the expression data according to such pseudotimes can be valuable for understanding the underlying regulator-gene interactions in a biological process, such as differentiation. However, the distribution of cells sampled along a transitional process, and hence that of the pseudotimes assigned to them, is not uniform. This prevents using many standard mathematical methods for analyzing the ordered gene expression states. We present Single-Cell Inference of Networks using Granger Ensembles (SCINGE), an algorithm for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell gene expression data. Given ordered single-cell data, SCINGE uses kernel-based Granger Causality regression, which smooths the irregular pseudotimes and missing expression values. It then aggregates the predictions from an ensemble of regression analyses with a modified Borda method to compile a ranked list of candidate interactions between transcriptional regulators and their target genes. In two mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation case studies, SCINGE outperforms other contemporary algorithms for gene network reconstruction. However, a more detailed examination reveals caveats about transcriptional network reconstruction with single-cell RNA-seq data. Network inference methods, including SCINGE, may have near random performance for predicting the targets of many individual regulators even if the aggregate performance is good. In addition, in some cases including cells' pseudotime values can hurt the performance of network reconstruction methods. A MATLAB implementation of SCINGE is available at https://github.com/gitter-lab/SCINGE.</p>},

   abstract = {Motivation:The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation. Results:In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses. Availability:The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE .

   abstract = {Methods to model dynamic changes in gene expression at a genome-wide level are not currently sufficient for large (temporally rich or single-cell) datasets. Variational autoencoders offer means to characterize large datasets and have been used effectively to characterize features of single-cell datasets. Here we extend these methods for use with gene expression time series data.We present RVAgene: a recurrent variational autoencoder to model gene expression dynamics. RVAgene learns to accurately and efficiently reconstruct temporal gene profiles. It also learns a low dimensional representation of the data via a recurrent encoder network that can be used for biological feature discovery, and from which we can generate new gene expression data by sampling the latent space. We test RVAgene on simulated and real biological datasets, including embryonic stem cell differentiation and kidney injury response dynamics. In all cases, RVAgene accurately reconstructed complex gene expression temporal profiles. Via cross validation, we show that a low-error latent space representation can be learnt using only a fraction of the data. Through clustering and gene ontology term enrichment analysis on the latent space, we demonstrate the potential of RVAgene for unsupervised discovery. In particular, RVAgene identifies new programs of shared gene regulation of Lox family genes in response to kidney injury.RVAgene is available in Python, at gihub: https://github.com/maclean-lab/RVAgene; Zenodo archive: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271097.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {<p> Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort <sup>1–4</sup> , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined <sup>5</sup> , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences <sup>6,7</sup> . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’ <sup>8</sup> —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years <sup>9</sup> . Despite recent progress <sup>10–14</sup> , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) <sup>15</sup> , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. </p>},

Yet, our structural understanding of how proteins interact with DNA is limited. We present MELD-DNA, a novel computational approach to predict the structures of protein–DNA complexes. The method combines molecular dynamics simulations with general knowledge or experimental information through Bayesian inference. The physical model is sensitive to sequence-dependent properties and conformational changes required for binding, while information accelerates sampling of bound conformations. MELD-DNA can: (i) sample multiple binding modes; (ii) identify the preferred binding mode from the ensembles; and (iii) provide qualitative binding preferences between DNA sequences. We first assess performance on a dataset of 15 protein–DNA complexes and compare it with state-of-the-art methodologies. Furthermore, for three selected complexes, we show sequence dependence effects of binding in MELD predictions. We expect that the results presented herein, together with the freely available software, will impact structural biology (by complementing DNA structural databases) and molecular recognition (by bringing new insights into aspects governing protein–DNA interactions).</p>},

We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of DNA binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each TF. We updated the genome tracks of TFBSs predicted with JASPAR profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse TFBS predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform JASPAR TFBS enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions.

However, the structurally intricate engagement of ZF domains with DNA has made their design challenging. Here we describe the screening of 49 billion protein–DNA interactions and the development of a deep-learning model, ZFDesign, that solves ZF design for any genomic target. ZFDesign is a modern machine learning method that models global and target-specific differences induced by a range of library environments and specifically takes into account compatibility of neighboring fingers using a novel hierarchical transformer architecture. We demonstrate the versatility of designed ZFs as nucleases as well as activators and repressors by seamless reprogramming of human transcription factors. These factors could be used to upregulate an allele of haploinsufficiency, downregulate a gain-of-function mutation or test the consequence of regulation of a single gene as opposed to the many genes that a transcription factor would normally influence. </p>},

Our 3D representation is computed as a collection of point-pair-features combined with the points and normals within a local vicinity. Our permutation invariant network design is inspired by PointNet and sets PPFNet to be ordering-free. As opposed to voxelization, our method is able to consume raw point clouds to exploit the full sparsity. PPFNet uses a novel $\textit\{N-tuple\}$ loss and architecture injecting the global information naturally into the local descriptor. It shows that context awareness also boosts the local feature representation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our network suggest increased recall, improved robustness and invariance as well as a vital step in the 3D descriptor extraction performance.},

   abstract = {<p> DNA-binding proteins play important roles in various cellular processes, but the mechanisms by which proteins recognize genomic target sites remain incompletely understood. Functional groups at the edges of the base pairs (bp) exposed in the DNA grooves represent physicochemical signatures. As these signatures enable proteins to form specific contacts between protein residues and bp, their study can provide mechanistic insights into protein–DNA binding. Existing experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, can reveal such mechanisms based on physicochemical interactions between proteins and their DNA target sites. However, the low throughput of structural biology methods limits mechanistic insights for selection of many genomic sites. High-throughput binding assays enable prediction of potential target sites by determining relative binding affinities of a protein to massive numbers of DNA sequences. Many currently available computational methods are based on the sequence of standard Watson–Crick bp. They assume that the contribution of overall binding affinity is independent for each base pair, or alternatively include dinucleotides or short <italic>k</italic> -mers. These methods cannot directly expand to physicochemical contacts, and they are not suitable to apply to DNA modifications or non-Watson–Crick bp. These variations include DNA methylation, and synthetic or mismatched bp. The proposed method, DeepRec, can predict relative binding affinities as function of physicochemical signatures and the effect of DNA methylation or other chemical modifications on binding. Sequence-based modeling methods are in comparison a coarse-grain description and cannot achieve such insights. Our chemistry-based modeling framework provides a path towards understanding genome function at a mechanistic level. </p>},

   abstract = {Protein-nucleic acid complexes play critical roles in biology. Despite considerable recent advances in protein structure prediction, the prediction of the structures of protein-nucleic acid complexes without homology to known complexes is a largely unsolved problem. Here we extend the RoseTTAFold end-to-end deep learning approach to modeling of nucleic acid and protein-nucleic acid complexes. We develop a single trained network, RoseTTAFoldNA, that rapidly produces 3D structure models with confidence estimates for protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes, and for RNA tertiary structures. In all three cases, confident predictions have considerably higher accuracy than current state of the art methods. RoseTTAFoldNA should be broadly useful for modeling the structure of naturally occurring protein-nucleic acid complexes, and for designing sequence specific RNA and DNA binding proteins. Main Text Current approaches to protein-nucleic acid complex structure prediction involve building models of the protein and nucleic acid components separately and then building up complexes using computational docking calculations [1-3]. RNA structure prediction has generally proceeded by first predicting the secondary structure (Watson/Crick base pairing) and then assembling the secondary structure into a tertiary structure [4-7]. More recently, deep learning methods have been used for contact prediction to aid in RNA structure determination [8], and to select models from ensembles generated using other structure sampling approaches [9]. Despite this progress, the prediction of the structure of nucleic acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes has lagged considerably behind the prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequences, which has been transformed by the high accuracy AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold methods.},

   abstract = {<p>Motivation: Recognition models for protein-DNA interactions, which allow the prediction of specificity for a DNA-binding domain based only on its sequence or the alteration of specificity through rational design, have long been a goal of computational biology. There has been some progress in constructing useful models, especially for C2H2 zinc finger proteins, but it remains a challenging problem with ample room for improvement. For most families of transcription factors the best available methods utilize k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms to make specificity predictions based on the average of the specificities of the k most similar proteins with defined specificities. Homeodomain (HD) proteins are the second most abundant family of transcription factors, after zinc fingers, in most metazoan genomes, and as a consequence an effective recognition model for this family would facilitate predictive models of many transcriptional regulatory networks within these genomes.</p>},

However, the structurally intricate engagement of ZF domains with DNA has made their design challenging. Here we describe the screening of 49 billion protein–DNA interactions and the development of a deep-learning model, ZFDesign, that solves ZF design for any genomic target. ZFDesign is a modern machine learning method that models global and target-specific differences induced by a range of library environments and specifically takes into account compatibility of neighboring fingers using a novel hierarchical transformer architecture. We demonstrate the versatility of designed ZFs as nucleases as well as activators and repressors by seamless reprogramming of human transcription factors. These factors could be used to upregulate an allele of haploinsufficiency, downregulate a gain-of-function mutation or test the consequence of regulation of a single gene as opposed to the many genes that a transcription factor would normally influence. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are fundamental to many biological processes. In this review, we provide a revised view of protein-DNA interactions that emphasizes the importance of the three-dimensional structures of both macromolecules. We divide protein-DNA interactions into two categories: those when the protein recognizes the unique chemical signatures of the DNA bases (base readout) and those when the protein recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA shape (shape readout). We further divide base readout into those interactions that occur in the major groove from those that occur in the minor groove. Analogously, the readout of the DNA shape is subdivided into global shape recognition (for example, when the DNA helix exhibits an overall bend) and local shape recognition (for example, when a base pair step is kinked or a region of the minor groove is narrow). Based on the &gt;1500 structures of protein-DNA complexes now available in the Protein Data Bank, we argue that individual DNA-binding proteins combine multiple readout mechanisms to achieve DNA-binding specificity. Specificity that distinguishes between families frequently involves base readout in the major groove, whereas shape readout is often exploited for higher resolution specificity, to distinguish between members within the same DNA-binding protein family.</p>},

In the P22 Arc repressor, the Phe-10 side chain is part of the hydrophobic core of the free protein but rotates out to pack against the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA in the repressor-operator complex. Characterization of a library of position 10 variants reveals that Phe is the only residue that results in fully active Arc. One class of mutants folds stably but binds operator with reduced affinity; another class is unstable. FV10, one member of the first class, binds operator DNA and nonoperator DNA almost equally well. The affinity differences between FV10 and wild type indicate that each Phe-10 side chain contributes 1.5–2.0 kcal to operator binding but less than 0.5 kcal/mol to nonoperator binding, demonstrating that contacts between Phe-10 and the operator DNA backbone contribute to binding specificity. This appears to be a direct contribution as the crystal structure of the FV10 dimer is similar to wild type and the Phe-10-DNA backbone interactions are the only contacts perturbed in the cocrystal structure of the FV10-operator complex.</p>},

Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.</p>},

We conclude that a single hydrogen bond is inadequate for uniquely identifying any particular base pair, as this leads to numerous degeneracies. However, using two hydrogen bonds, fidelity of base pair recognition may be achieved. We propose specific amino-acid side chain interactions involving two hydrogen bonds as a component of the recognition system for base pairs. In the major groove we suggest that asparagine or glutamine binds to adenine of the base pair or arginine binds to guanine. In the minor groove, we suggest an interaction between asparagine or glutamine with guanine of the base pair. We also discuss the role that ions and other amino-acid side chains may play in recognition interactions.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The transcriptome of every cell is orchestrated by the complex network of interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites on DNA. Disruption of this network can result in many forms of organism malfunction but also can be the substrate of positive natural selection. However, understanding the specific determinants of each of these individual TF-DNA interactions is a challenging task as it requires integrating the multiple possible mechanisms by which a given TF ends up interacting with a specific genomic region. These mechanisms include DNA motif preferences, which can be determined by nucleotide sequence but also by DNA’s shape; post-translational modifications of the TF, such as phosphorylation; and dimerization partners and co-factors, which can mediate multiple forms of direct or indirect cooperative binding. Binding can also be affected by epigenetic modifications of putative target regions, including DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy. In this review, we describe how all these mechanisms have a role and crosstalk in one specific family of TFs, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), with a very conserved DNA binding domain and a similar DNA preferred motif, the E-box. Here, we compile and discuss a rich catalog of strategies used by bHLH to acquire TF-specific genome-wide landscapes of binding sites.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Knowledge of how proteins interact with DNA is essential for understanding gene regulation. Although DNA-binding specificities for thousands of transcription factors (TFs) have been determined, the specific amino acid–base interactions comprising their structural interfaces are largely unknown. This lack of resolution hampers attempts to leverage these data in order to predict specificities for uncharacterized TFs or TFs mutated in disease. Here we introduce recognition code learning via automated mapping of protein–DNA structural interfaces (rCLAMPS), a probabilistic approach that uses DNA-binding specificities for TFs from the same structural family to simultaneously infer both which nucleotide positions are contacted by particular amino acids within the TF as well as a recognition code that relates each base-contacting amino acid to nucleotide preferences at the DNA positions it contacts. We apply rCLAMPS to homeodomains, the second largest family of TFs in metazoans and show that it learns a highly effective recognition code that can predict de novo DNA-binding specificities for TFs. Furthermore, we show that the inferred amino acid–nucleotide contacts reveal whether and how nucleotide preferences at individual binding site positions are altered by mutations within TFs. Our approach is an important step toward automatically uncovering the determinants of protein–DNA specificity from large compendia of DNA-binding specificities and inferring the altered functionalities of TFs mutated in disease.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are fundamental to many biological processes. In this review, we provide a revised view of protein-DNA interactions that emphasizes the importance of the three-dimensional structures of both macromolecules. We divide protein-DNA interactions into two categories: those when the protein recognizes the unique chemical signatures of the DNA bases (base readout) and those when the protein recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA shape (shape readout). We further divide base readout into those interactions that occur in the major groove from those that occur in the minor groove. Analogously, the readout of the DNA shape is subdivided into global shape recognition (for example, when the DNA helix exhibits an overall bend) and local shape recognition (for example, when a base pair step is kinked or a region of the minor groove is narrow). Based on the &gt;1500 structures of protein-DNA complexes now available in the Protein Data Bank, we argue that individual DNA-binding proteins combine multiple readout mechanisms to achieve DNA-binding specificity. Specificity that distinguishes between families frequently involves base readout in the major groove, whereas shape readout is often exploited for higher resolution specificity, to distinguish between members within the same DNA-binding protein family.</p>},

Because the nucleotide sequence of the core motif is often not sufficient for identifying a genomic target, we refined the description of TF binding sites by introducing a combination of DNA sequence and shape features, which consistently improved the modeling of in vitro TF−DNA binding specificities. Although additional factors affect TF binding in vivo, shape-augmented models reveal binding specificity mechanisms that are not apparent from sequence alone.</p>},

While there has been some success in reprogramming naturally occurring DBPs using selection methods, the computational design of new DBPs that recognize arbitrary target sites remains an outstanding challenge. We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove, and employ this method in conjunction with experimental screening to generate binders for 5 distinct DNA targets. These binders exhibit specificity closely matching the computational models for the target DNA sequences at as many as 6 base positions and affinities as low as 30-100 nM. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target site complex is in close agreement with the design model, highlighting the accuracy of the design method. The designed DBPs function in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells to repress and activate transcription of neighboring genes. Our method is a substantial step towards a general route to small and hence readily deliverable sequence-specific DBPs for gene regulation and editing.},

   abstract = {<p> DNA A-tracts have been defined as four or more consecutive A·T base pairs without a TpA step. When inserted in phase with the DNA helical repeat, bending is manifested macroscopically as anomalous migration on polyacrylamide gels, first observed &gt;20 years ago. An unsolved conundrum is why DNA containing in-phase A-tract repeats of A <sub>4</sub> T <sub>4</sub> are bent, whereas T <sub>4</sub> A <sub>4</sub> is straight. We have determined the solution structures of the DNA duplexes formed by d(GCAAAATTTTGC) [A4T4] and d(CGTTTTAAAACG) [T4A4] with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[10pt]\{article\} \usepackage\{amsmath\} \usepackage\{wasysym\} \usepackage\{amsfonts\} \usepackage\{amssymb\} \usepackage\{amsbsy\} \usepackage\{mathrsfs\} \pagestyle\{empty\} \setlength\{\oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} \begin\{document\} \begin\{equation*\}\{\mathrm\{NH\}\}_\{4\}^\{+\}\end\{equation*\}\end\{document\}</tex-math> </inline-formula> counterions by using NMR spectroscopy, including refinement with residual dipolar couplings. Analysis of the structures shows that the ApT step has a large negative roll, resulting in a local bend toward the minor groove, whereas the TpA step has a positive roll and locally bends toward the major groove. For A4T4, this bend is nearly in phase with bends at the two A-tract junctions, resulting in an overall bend toward the minor groove of the A-tract, whereas for T4A4, the bends oppose each other, resulting in a relatively straight helix. NMR-based structural modeling of d(CAAAATTTTG) <sub>15</sub> and d(GTTTTAAAAC) <sub>15</sub> reveals that the former forms a left-handed superhelix with a diameter of ≈110 Å and pitch of 80 Å, similar to DNA in the nucleosome, whereas the latter has a gentle writhe with a pitch of &gt;250 Å and diameter of ≈50 Å. Results of gel electrophoretic mobility studies are consistent with the higher-order structure of the DNA and furthermore depend on the nature of the monovalent cation present in the running buffer. </p>},

   abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of protein-DNA binding is critical in comprehending gene regulation. Three-dimensional DNA shape plays a key role in these mechanisms. In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, Deep DNAshape, that fundamentally changes the current k -mer based high-throughput prediction of DNA shape features by accurately accounting for the influence of extended flanking regions, without the need for extensive molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. By using the Deep DNAshape method, refined DNA shape features can be predicted for any length and number of DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner, providing a deeper understanding of the effects of flanking regions on DNA shape in a target region of a sequence. Deep DNAshape method provides access to the influence of distant flanking regions on a region of interest. Our findings reveal that DNA shape readout mechanisms of a core target are quantitatively affected by flanking regions, including extended flanking regions, providing valuable insights into the detailed structural readout mechanisms of protein-DNA binding. Furthermore, when incorporated in machine learning models, the features generated by Deep DNAshape improve the model prediction accuracy. Collectively, Deep DNAshape can serve as a versatile and powerful tool for diverse DNA structure-related studies.},

Herein, after constructing such pockets, we show using the "fragment reaction" and its analyses by MALDI-TOF and LC–MS mass spectrometry techniques, that several protoribosome constructs are indeed capable of mediating peptide-bond formation. These findings present strong evidence supporting our hypothesis on origin of life and on ribosome's construction, thus suggesting that the protoribosome may be the missing link between the RNA dominated world and the contemporary nucleic acids/proteins life.</p>},

   abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus with a ten-kilobase single-stranded RNA genome. HIV-1 must express all of its gene products from a single primary transcript, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce diverse protein products that include structural proteins and regulatory factors1,2. Despite the critical role of alternative splicing, the mechanisms that drive the choice of splice site are poorly understood. Synonymous RNA mutations that lead to severe defects in splicing and viral replication indicate the presence of unknown cis-regulatory elements3. Here we use dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) to investigate the structure of HIV-1 RNA in cells, and develop an algorithm that we name 'detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization' (DREEM), which reveals the alternative conformations that are assumed by the same RNA sequence. Contrary to previous models that have analysed population averages4, our results reveal heterogeneous regions of RNA structure across the entire HIV-1 genome. In addition to confirming that in vitro characterized5 alternative structures for the HIV-1 Rev responsive element also exist in cells, we discover alternative conformations at critical splice sites that influence the ratio of transcript isoforms. Our simultaneous measurement of splicing and intracellular RNA structure provides evidence for the long-standing hypothesis6-8 that heterogeneity in RNA conformation regulates splice-site use and viral gene expression.},

   abstract = {Atomic-accuracy structure prediction of macromolecules should be achievable by optimizing a physically realistic energy function but is presently precluded by incomplete sampling of a biopolymer's many degrees of freedom. We present herein a working hypothesis, called the "stepwise ansatz," for recursively constructing well-packed atomic-detail models in small steps, enumerating several million conformations for each monomer, and covering all build-up paths. By making use of high-performance computing and the Rosetta framework, we provide first tests of this hypothesis on a benchmark of 15 RNA loop-modeling problems drawn from riboswitches, ribozymes, and the ribosome, including 10 cases that are not solvable by current knowledge-based modeling approaches. For each loop problem, this deterministic stepwise assembly method either reaches atomic accuracy or exposes flaws in Rosetta's all-atom energy function, indicating the resolution of the conformational sampling bottleneck. As a further rigorous test, we have carried out a blind all-atom prediction for a noncanonical RNA motif, the C7.2 tetraloop/receptor, and validated this model through nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping experiments. Stepwise assembly is an enumerative, ab initio build-up method that systematically outperforms existing Monte Carlo and knowledge-based methods for 3D structure prediction.},

   abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

   abstract = {<p>Protein translation is orchestrated through tRNA aminoacylation and ribosomal elongation. Among the highly conserved structure of tRNAs, they have distinguishing features which promote interaction with their cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS). These key features are referred to as identity elements. In our study, we investigated the tRNA:aaRS pair that installs the 22nd amino acid, pyrrolysine (tRNAPyl:PylRS). Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetases (PylRSs) are naturally encoded in some archaeal and bacterial genomes to acylate tRNAPyl with pyrrolysine. Their large amino acid binding pocket and poor recognition of the tRNA anticodon have been instrumental in incorporating &amp;gt;200 noncanonical amino acids. PylRS enzymes can be divided into three classes based on their genomic structure. Two classes contain both an N-terminal and C-terminal domain, however the third class (ΔpylSn) lacks the N-terminal domain. In this study we explored the tRNA identity elements for a ΔpylSn tRNAPyl from Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus which drives the orthogonality seen with its cognate PylRS (MaPylRS). From aminoacylation and translation assays we identified five key elements in ΔpylSn tRNAPyl necessary for MaPylRS activity. The absence of a base (position 8) and a G–U wobble pair (G28:U42) were found to affect the high-resolution structure of the tRNA, while molecular dynamic simulations led us to acknowledge the rigidity imparted from the G–C base pairs (G3:C70 and G5:C68).</p>},

We describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), which combines a residue-based representation of amino acids and DNA bases with an atomic representation of all other groups to model assemblies that contain proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications, given their sequences and chemical structures. By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we designed and experimentally validated, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light-harvesting molecule bilin.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes. Users can upload their own three-dimensional structures or enter a Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID of an existing structure. The RNAscape webserver allows users to customize visualizations through various settings as desired. URL: https://rnascape.usc.edu/.</p>},

   abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of interfacial water molecules in the structures of 109 unique protein-DNA complexes is presented together with a new view on their role in protein-DNA recognition. Location of interfacial water molecules as reported in the crystal structures and as emerging from a series of molecular dynamics studies on protein-DNA complexes with explicit solvent and counterions, was analyzed based on their acceptor, donor hydrogen bond relationships with the atoms and residues of the macromolecules, electrostatic field calculations and packing density considerations. Water molecules for the purpose of this study have been categorized into four classes: viz. (I) those that contact both the protein and the DNA simultaneously and thus mediate recognition directly; (II) those that contact either the protein or the DNA exclusively via hydrogen bonds solvating each solute separately; (III) those that contact the hydrophobic groups in either the protein or the DNA; and, lastly (IV) those that contact another water molecule. Of the 17,963 crystallographic water molecules under examination, about 6% belong to class I and 76% belong to class II. About three-fourths of class I and class II water molecules are exclusively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor atoms of both protein and DNA. Noting that DNA is polyanionic, it is significant that a majority of the crystallographically observed water molecules as well as those from molecular dynamics simulations should be involved in facilitating binding by screening unfavorable electrostatics. Less than 2% of the reported water molecules occur between hydrogen bond donor atoms of protein and acceptor atoms of DNA. These represent cases where protein atoms cannot reach out to DNA to make favorable hydrogen bond interactions due to packing/structural restrictions and interfacial water molecules provide an extension to side-chains to accomplish hydrogen bonding.},

In this 10th release and 20th-anniversary update, the CORE collection has expanded with 329 new profiles. We updated three existing profiles and provided orthogonal support for 72 profiles from the previous release's UNVALIDATED collection. Altogether, the JASPAR 2024 update provides a 20% increase in CORE profiles from the previous release. A trimming algorithm enhanced profiles by removing low information content flanking base pairs, which were likely uninformative (within the capacity of the PFM models) for TFBS predictions and modelling TF-DNA interactions. This release includes enhanced metadata, featuring a refined classification for plant TFs’ structural DNA-binding domains. The new JASPAR collections prompt updates to the genomic tracks of predicted TF binding sites (TFBSs) in 8 organisms, with human and mouse tracks available as native tracks in the UCSC Genome browser. All data are available through the JASPAR web interface and programmatically through its API and the updated Bioconductor and pyJASPAR packages.

Like many HD proteins, Gsx factors bind A/T-rich DNA sequences prompting the following question: How do HD factors that bind similar DNA sequences in vitro regulate specific target genes in vivo? Prior studies revealed that Gsx factors bind DNA both as a monomer on individual A/T-rich sites and as a cooperative homodimer to two sites spaced precisely 7 bp apart. However, the mechanistic basis for Gsx–DNA binding and cooperativity is poorly understood. Here, we used biochemical, biophysical, structural and modeling approaches to (i) show that Gsx factors are monomers in solution and require DNA for cooperative complex formation, (ii) define the affinity and thermodynamic binding parameters of Gsx2/DNA interactions, (iii) solve a high-resolution monomer/DNA structure that reveals that Gsx2 induces a 20° bend in DNA, (iv) identify a Gsx2 protein–protein interface required for cooperative DNA binding and (v) determine that flexible spacer DNA sequences enhance Gsx2 cooperativity on dimer sites. Altogether, our results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the protein and DNA structural determinants that underlie cooperative DNA binding by Gsx factors.</p>},

The inference time for DeepPBS is sufficiently fast for analyzing simulation trajectories, as demonstrated on a molecular-dynamics simulation of a Drosophila Hox-DNA tertiary complex with its cofactor.

   abstract = {<p>Knowledge of protein–DNA binding specificity has important implications in understanding DNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation and developing therapeutic drugs. Previous studies demonstrated hydrogen bonds between amino acid side chains and DNA bases play major roles in specific protein–DNA interactions. In this paper, we investigated the roles of individual DNA strands and protein secondary structure types in specific protein–DNA recognition based on side chain-base hydrogen bonds. By comparing the contribution of each DNA strand to the overall binding specificity between DNA-binding proteins with different degrees of binding specificity, we found that highly specific DNA-binding proteins show balanced hydrogen bonding with each of the two DNA strands while multi-specific DNA binding proteins are generally biased towards one strand. Protein-base pair hydrogen bonds, in which both bases of a base pair are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid side chains, are more prevalent in the highly specific protein–DNA complexes than those in the multi-specific group. Amino acids involved in side chain-base hydrogen bonds favor strand and coil secondary structure types in highly specific DNA-binding proteins while multi-specific DNA-binding proteins prefer helices.</p>},

Structural models of proteins bound to nucleic acids (NA) provide insights into the chemical, electrostatic, and geometric properties of the protein structure that give rise to NA binding but are scarce relative to models of unbound proteins. We developed a deep learning approach for predicting PNA binding given the unbound structure of a protein that we call PNAbind. Our method utilizes graph neural networks to encode the spatial distribution of physicochemical and geometric properties of protein structures that are predictive of NA binding. Using global physicochemical encodings, our models predict the overall binding function of a protein, and using local encodings, they predict the location of individual NA binding residues. Our models can discriminate between specificity for DNA or RNA binding, and we show that predictions made on computationally derived protein structures can be used to gain mechanistic understanding of chemical and structural features that determine NA recognition. Binding site predictions were validated against benchmark datasets, achieving AUROC scores in the range of 0.92–0.95. We applied our models to the HIV-1 restriction factor APOBEC3G and showed that our model predictions are consistent with and help explain experimental RNA binding data.</p>},
