    Predicting DNA/RNA binding sites on a given protein surface is an important computational task since experimentally determining such information is often expensive and time consuming. Such binding site prediction task can be formulated as a node classification task over a 3D mesh representing the protein surface, with features over the vertices and edges of the mesh representing various geometrical and physicochemical features of the protein structure. At our lab we developed a deep learning based method, which independently classifies mesh vertices as binding and non-binding sites. This often results in irregular binding site predictions over the protein surface. However, intuitively, binding site predictions should be contiguous and not patchy i.e. as ``smooth" as possible while being correct. In this chapter, we describe what such kind of ``smoothness" entails and we improve upon the original architecture by designing a network layer based on a  probabilistic Continuous Conditional Random Field (CCRF) model, which increases smoothness of binding site prediction while improving prediction accuracy of the model. This network layer was incorporated into the original model and will be published as the Geobind package (Sagendorf et. al).
