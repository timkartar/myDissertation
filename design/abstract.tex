Recently significant advances have been made in applying generative modeling techniques in various
aspects of structural biology like drug discovery, functional protein and nucleic acid sequence
generation etc. Various methods have been developed for binding site prediction on protein
surfaces. This constitutes an opportunity to work on a generalized generative model for
binding element design. In simple terms, given a binding site region on a protein, our goal
is to generate binding elements (nucleic acid PWM or drug molecule) that could potentially
bind to the given site. In this proposal, we propose a generative adversarial network model
which can accomplish this task.
