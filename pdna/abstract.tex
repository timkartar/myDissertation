Structure based study and mechanistic prediction of protein-DNA specificity is a key interest in the
current state of structural biology. In particular, analyzing protein-DNA co-crystals from PDB has
        become a staple in everyday structural biology. However, we still do not have co-crystals
        for a particular protein bound to a varied set of DNA structures. On the other hand, these variations in
        DNA-binding are available from experimental data. These experiments do not easily give
        insight into binding mechanism and are expensive to perform. So a valuable question worth
        asking is given one protein-DNA co-crystal can one predict the full range of DNA binding
        specificity for the protein in the co-crystal in question. So, a computatinal model which
        can bridge these two types of data sources would be very valuable.

        Various models have been developed to answer a similar question in some form. A lot of them
        are protein specific and operate on available experimental binding specificity data and aim
        to predict the same for a given dna sequence. Some of them are family specific and aim to predict binding
        specificity in terms of Position Weight Matrices (PWM) based on sequence and/or structure of
        a given protein. There is lack of a model of protein-DNA binidng specificity which is more
        general and works across protein families.

        In fact, the space of dna-binding proteins and corresponding binding mechanism is extremely
        varied. Local chemical interactions as well as energetics of the global shape of
        protein and DNA in context of binding determine these specificities. Current availibility of structural
        data, although not abundant but suffices to model this complicated problem via deep
        learning. In this work we build a modular deep learning approach which can learn from
        various aspects of a given co-crystal and produces binding specificity prediction.
